# Quarantine-Quash
Quarantine Quash is a rough-around-the-edges text-based dungeon crawler game coded in Python 3.7.7.   Players are tasked with exploring elaborate mazes and slaying internet trolls and haters while trapped in Quarantine, eventually battling a Virus known as the Rona.  Using only keyboard text features, Quarantine Quash creates a unique and vintage feel to a modern style game.  Bearing Easter Eggs, character selection, and a combat system based on Rock, Paper, Scissors, Quarantine Quash can entertain and create anywhere from 5 minutes to over an hourâ€™s worth of gameplay.
